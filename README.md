# olb-ios
The iOS app for openLeaderboard.

## Run
Open in xcode with `olb-ios/OpenLeaderboard/OpenLeaderboard.xcodeproj`

Run this with the iPhone 11 Pro simulator.

Don't run it on an actual device if you're hosting the server on your computer, as it won't be able to connect.

Be sure to start the backend before running the app.

## Notes
Our demo video does a good job of describing what should happen on the different screens.

If you just built the backend there won't be any data in the database, so you'll need to create a second user to submit matches etc. I can make a script to populate it with dummy data if you want though.

To login as a new user you have to close and restart the app.
